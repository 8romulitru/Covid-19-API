## Step 1: Install the ADMS-VX6 Software
 
Before you can use the ADMS-VX6 software, you need to install it on your computer. You can download the software from the RT Systems website or use the CD that comes with the kit. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the software. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
## Step 2: Connect Your Yaesu VX-6 Radio to Your Computer
 
Next, you need to connect your Yaesu VX-6 radio to your computer using the USB-57B cable. The cable has a USB connector on one end and a 4-pin connector on the other end. Plug the USB connector into a free USB port on your computer and plug the 4-pin connector into the MIC/SP jack on the side of your radio.
 
Make sure your radio is turned off before you connect it. Also, make sure you have fresh batteries in your radio or use an external power source.
 
## Step 3: Run the ADMS-VX6 Software
 
Now you are ready to run the ADMS-VX6 software on your computer. You can find it in your Start menu or Applications folder. When you launch the software, you will see a spreadsheet-like interface with tabs for different settings and features of your radio.
 
You can either start from scratch or read the current configuration from your radio. To read from your radio, click on File > Read Data from Radio. A dialog box will appear asking you to turn on your radio and press any key. Do so and wait for the software to read your radio data.
 
## Step 4: Edit Your Radio Data
 
Once you have read your radio data or created a new file, you can edit it using the ADMS-VX6 software. You can change various settings such as frequency, mode, tone, name, offset, power, scan mode, etc. for each memory channel.
