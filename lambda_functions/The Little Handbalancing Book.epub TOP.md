## What is Handbalancing?
 
Handbalancing is the art of balancing on your hands, either on the floor or on props such as blocks, canes, or poles. It is a form of gymnastics that dates back to ancient times and has been practiced by acrobats, circus performers, martial artists, and yogis. Handbalancing can also be considered a form of calisthenics, as it uses your own bodyweight to build strength and endurance.
 
Handbalancing has many benefits for your physical and mental health. It can improve your posture, alignment, mobility, and stability. It can also enhance your concentration, focus, confidence, and creativity. Handbalancing can be a meditative practice that helps you connect with your body and mind, as well as a playful activity that brings you joy and satisfaction.
 
## How to Start Handbalancing?
 
If you are new to handbalancing, you might wonder how to start and what to expect. The good news is that handbalancing is not as hard as it looks, and anyone can learn it with proper guidance and practice. The bad news is that handbalancing is not easy either, and it takes time and patience to master it.
 
The first step to start handbalancing is to prepare your body and mind. You need to warm up your wrists, shoulders, spine, hips, and legs before attempting any handstand. You also need to clear your mind of any doubts or fears and adopt a positive attitude. Remember that handbalancing is a journey, not a destination, and that every attempt is a learning opportunity.
 
The second step is to learn the basic techniques and positions of handbalancing. You need to understand how to align your body in a straight line from your hands to your feet, how to balance your weight on your palms and fingers, how to breathe properly, and how to exit safely from a handstand. You also need to familiarize yourself with the different variations of handstands, such as the wall handstand, the free handstand, the tuck handstand, the straddle handstand, and the pike handstand.
