Atlantida: El Mundo Antediluviano (Atlantis: The Antediluvian World) is a book by Ignatius Donnelly, a former US congressman and writer, who published it in 1882. The book is one of the most influential and popular works on the topic of Atlantis, the mythical island that Plato described as a powerful and advanced civilization that was destroyed by a cataclysmic event.
 
Donnelly's book argues that Atlantis was a real historical place, and that it was the original source of all the ancient cultures and civilizations around the world. He claims that Atlantis was located in the Atlantic Ocean, between America and Europe, and that its survivors migrated to different regions after the disaster. He supports his theory with various evidence, such as similarities in language, mythology, religion, art, architecture, and customs among different peoples. He also cites ancient texts, legends, folklore, and archaeological findings that he believes point to the existence and influence of Atlantis.

The book is divided into four parts: The History of Atlantis, The Antiquity of Atlantis, The Civilization of Atlantis, and The Destruction of Atlantis. In each part, Donnelly presents his arguments and analysis in a detailed and persuasive manner. He also includes illustrations, maps, charts, and tables to support his claims. The book is written in an engaging and accessible style, and it appeals to both scholars and general readers who are interested in the mystery and legacy of Atlantis.
 
Atlantida: El Mundo Antediluviano is a classic work on Atlantology, and it has inspired many other authors and researchers to explore the subject further. It has also influenced popular culture, such as novels, movies, comics, games, and music. The book is available for free download in various formats, such as PDF, EPUB, and MOBI[^2^] [^3^]. You can also read it online or borrow it from the Internet Archive[^1^]. If you are curious about Atlantis and its impact on human history and culture, you should definitely read this book.
  
One of the most intriguing aspects of Donnelly's book is his comparison of Atlantis with other ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Greece, India, China, Peru, and Mexico. He shows how these cultures share common elements that suggest a common origin in Atlantis. For example, he points out that the pyramids, the zodiac, the cross, the swastika, the sun worship, and the flood myths are found in both hemispheres. He also argues that the Phoenicians, the Celts, the Etruscans, and the Mayans were descendants of Atlanteans who preserved some of their knowledge and traditions.
 
Another interesting aspect of Donnelly's book is his attempt to reconstruct the geography, history, and society of Atlantis based on Plato's account and other sources. He describes Atlantis as a large island with a fertile plain surrounded by mountains and canals. He says that Atlantis had a powerful navy and army, and that it conquered many lands and islands. He also says that Atlantis had a complex political system, with ten kings who ruled over different regions and who met periodically in a central temple. He also depicts Atlantis as a highly civilized and cultured place, with advanced science, art, literature, religion, and law.
 
However, Donnelly's book is not without flaws and criticisms. Some of his evidence is based on speculation, coincidence, or outdated information. Some of his arguments are contradicted by modern scientific discoveries and historical research. Some of his sources are unreliable or misinterpreted. Some of his claims are exaggerated or biased. For these reasons, many scholars and experts have rejected or challenged Donnelly's theory of Atlantis as a historical fact. Nevertheless, his book remains a fascinating and influential work that stimulates the imagination and curiosity of many readers.
