If you're looking for a mastering solution that does it all, you might want to check out Slate Digital's FG-X 2. This plugin is powered by two incredible modules: FG-Comp and FG-Level. FG-Comp is designed to maintain all the original punch and transients of your mix. FG-Level is an intelligent processor whose algorithm analyzes the input signal to determine whether to apply saturation or limiting based on the unique frequency content of your track[^1^].

FG-X 2 features four modes that were carefully crafted to cover everything from extremely transparent limiting with zero pumping all the way to loud processing with gorgeous, colorful saturation. Once you find the sound you're looking for, adjust your overall level with the Gain knob[^1^].
 
FG-X 2 comes with two presentation and processing views: Easy, the default setting for a fast & loud result, and Advanced, which unleashes an extra set of parameters for more advanced users. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned studio veteran, FG-X 2 has everything you need to get the job doneâand then some[^1^].
 
In this article, we'll show you how to use FG-X 2 to master your tracks in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Load FG-X 2 on your master bus
 
The first thing you need to do is load FG-X 2 on your master bus. You can do this by opening your DAW of choice and inserting FG-X 2 as the last plugin on your master channel. Make sure you have enough headroom before applying any processing. A good rule of thumb is to leave about -6 dB of peak level on your master meter.
 
## Step 2: Choose a mode and adjust the threshold
 
The next thing you need to do is choose a mode and adjust the threshold. The mode determines how FG-X 2 will process your signal. There are four modes to choose from: Constant Gain Monitoring (CGM), Intelligent Transient Preservation (ITP), Loud & Proud (L&P), and Dynamic Perception (DP). Each mode has its own sonic characteristics and advantages. Here's a brief overview of each mode:
 
- CGM: This mode is the most transparent and natural sounding. It preserves the dynamics and transients of your mix without adding any coloration or distortion. It's ideal for acoustic, classical, jazz, or any genre that requires a high level of fidelity.
- ITP: This mode is similar to CGM, but with a twist. It applies a subtle amount of saturation and limiting based on the frequency content of your signal. It's designed to enhance the perceived loudness and punch of your mix without sacrificing clarity or detail. It's great for pop, rock, hip hop, or any genre that needs some extra energy and impact.
- L&P: This mode is the most aggressive and colorful. It applies a generous amount of saturation and limiting based on the level of your signal. It's designed to make your mix sound loud and proud, with rich harmonics and distortion. It's perfect for EDM, metal, or any genre that demands maximum loudness and attitude.
- DP: This mode is the most dynamic and adaptive. It applies a variable amount of saturation and limiting based on the transient content of your signal. It's designed to make your mix sound more lively and exciting, with enhanced contrast and depth. It's suitable for any genre that needs some extra movement and dimension.

To choose a mode, simply click on one of the four buttons at the top of the plugin window. You can also switch between modes by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. To adjust the threshold, drag the slider below the mode buttons until you see some gain reduction on the meter. The threshold determines how much processing will be applied to your signal. A lower threshold means more processing, while a higher threshold means less processing.
