By downloading and updating the maintenance manual for Airbus A320, you can ensure that you have the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to operate and maintain this aircraft safely and efficiently.
  
In this article, we will show you how to perform some common tasks using the maintenance manual for Airbus A320. These tasks include checking the oil level of the engine and the APU, filling the hydraulic fluid reservoir, and inspecting the MLG shock absorbers.
 
## Checking the Oil Level of the Engine and the APU
 
The oil level of the engine and the APU should be checked before each flight or at least once a day. The oil level should be within the normal range indicated on the dipstick or the gauge. If the oil level is low, it should be replenished with the appropriate type and quantity of oil.
 
To check the oil level of the engine, you need to access the engine oil servicing panel located on the nacelle. You need to open the panel and remove the dipstick. You need to wipe the dipstick with a clean cloth and reinsert it fully. You need to wait for 10 seconds and then pull out the dipstick again. You need to read the oil level on the dipstick and compare it with the normal range marked on it. You need to repeat this procedure for each engine.
 
To check the oil level of the APU, you need to access the APU compartment located in the tail cone. You need to open the access door and locate the APU oil servicing panel. You need to open the panel and read the oil level on the gauge. You need to compare it with the normal range marked on it.
 
To replenish the oil level of the engine or the APU, you need to use a funnel and a hose connected to an oil container. You need to insert the funnel into the oil filler opening and pour the oil slowly until the desired level is reached. You need to use only approved oil types as specified in the maintenance manual. You need to close the filler opening and secure it with a cap. You need to close and lock the servicing panel and access door.
 
## Filling the Hydraulic Fluid Reservoir
 
The hydraulic fluid reservoir should be filled before each flight or at least once a day. The hydraulic fluid level should be within the normal range indicated on the sight glass or the gauge. If the hydraulic fluid level is low, it should be replenished with the appropriate type and quantity of fluid.
 
To fill the hydraulic fluid reservoir, you need to access the hydraulic servicing panel located on each wing root fairing. You need to open the panel and locate the filler cap for each hydraulic system (green, blue, or yellow). You need to remove the filler cap and insert a funnel into the filler opening. You need to pour hydraulic fluid slowly until it reaches the normal range on the sight glass or gauge. You need to use only approved hydraulic fluid types as specified in the maintenance manual. You need to close the filler opening and secure it with a cap. You need to close and lock the servicing panel.
 
## Inspecting
the MLG Shock Absorbers
 
The MLG shock absorbers should be inspected before each flight or at least once a day. The shock absorbers should have sufficient fluid level and charge pressure to ensure proper damping and landing performance. The fluid level and charge pressure can be checked by measuring the dimension H between the upper and lower shock absorber sleeves.
 
To inspect the MLG shock absorbers, you need to access the MLG wheel well located under each wing. You need to locate the shock absorber assembly and measure the dimension H with a ruler or a tape measure. You need to compare the dimension H with the limits specified in the maintenance manual. If the dimension H is within the limits, no action is required. If the dimension H is out of limits, you need to perform further checks or actions as instructed in the maintenance manual. These may include filling the hydraulic power accumulators with nitrogen, filling the MLG two-stage shock absorber with hydraulic fluid, or performing a functional check of the MLG shock absorber fluid level or charge pressure.
