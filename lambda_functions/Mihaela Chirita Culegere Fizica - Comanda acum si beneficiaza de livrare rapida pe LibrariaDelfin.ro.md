This is a series of six physics workbooks for grades 9 to 12, written by Mihaela Chirita, a physics teacher with over 33 years of experience. She teaches at the prestigious National College Sfantul Sava in Bucharest and is a graduate of the Faculty of Physics at the University of Bucharest.
 
Mihaela Chirita Culegere Fizica covers all the topics of physics taught in high schools in Romania, according to the national curriculum and the standards of the Ministry of Education. The workbooks contain problems similar to those given at the baccalaureate exams, with different levels of difficulty. The workbooks are composed of a theoretical part, as well as a part of proposed problems, plus detailed results and scoring schemes for better understanding of the material.

The workbooks are suitable for students who have three hours of study per week, but also for other students. Some of the chapters are optional and are addressed to students who want to know very well this discipline. The physics workbooks complement the preparation for the baccalaureate exam and help develop analytical, synthetic, and intellectual skills to apply theoretical knowledge.
 
The book is a synthesis of a rich experience accumulated by the author and offers the possibility to go through the entire baccalaureate program, as well as to successfully prepare for the admission exam in higher education. A special emphasis was placed on explaining physical phenomena, clear solutions, and using units of measurement in the international system of units. All proposed problems have examples of solutions, necessary for students to understand the correct method of solving and to acquire useful notions. All problems have indications of solving and answers both in literary and numerical form.

One of the main benefits of physics workbooks is that they provide students with practical work, which is essential for learning science. Practical work allows students to see first-hand how scientists and technicians work, to engage with scientific phenomena, and to develop practical skills and attitudes that will be valuable in their future careers[^1^]. Practical work also helps students to develop 21st century transferable skills, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, and collaboration.
 
However, practical work also has its challenges, such as finding suitable space, time, and resources, ensuring health and safety, and dealing with student inexperience. That is why physics workbooks can be very helpful, as they provide guidance on how to plan and carry out practical activities safely and effectively. They also provide step-by-step instructions, diagrams, examples, indications, and answers for each problem. This way, students can learn from their mistakes and improve their understanding of physics concepts and methods.
 
Mihaela Chirita Culegere Fizica is one of the best physics workbooks for high school students in Romania, as it offers a comprehensive and reliable coverage of all the topics of physics taught in grades 9 to 12. It also prepares students for the baccalaureate exam and the admission exam in higher education. The author of the workbook is a physics teacher with over 33 years of experience, who knows how to make physics fun, real, and interesting. She also explains physical phenomena clearly and uses units of measurement in the international system of units.
