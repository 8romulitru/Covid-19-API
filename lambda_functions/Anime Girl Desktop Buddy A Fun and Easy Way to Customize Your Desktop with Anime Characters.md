If you are a fan of anime and want to spice up your desktop with some cute and lively virtual companions, you might be interested in getting an anime girl desktop buddy. An anime girl desktop buddy is a program that allows you to have one or more animated characters on your screen, dancing, singing, or just hanging out with you. You can interact with them, customize their appearance, and even import your own models from other sources.

There are many options for getting an anime girl desktop buddy, but one of the most popular and easy to use is Desktop MMD. Desktop MMD is a Steam application that lets you create and manage your own desktop mascots using the MikuMikuDance (MMD) engine. MMD is a free software that allows users to create 3D animations and models of characters, especially from anime and video games.
 
With Desktop MMD, you can choose from a variety of default models, such as Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin, Megurine Luka, and more. You can also browse the Steam Workshop and download hundreds of user-made models, ranging from popular anime characters like Naruto, One Piece, or Dragon Ball, to original creations and fan art. You can even import your own models if you know how to use MMD or other 3D modeling software.
 
Once you have your models, you can place them anywhere on your desktop and adjust their size, position, angle, and transparency. You can also select different animations and songs for them to perform, or let them move randomly. You can have as many desktop buddies as you want, and they will interact with each other and with your mouse cursor. You can also toggle their visibility and mute their sound whenever you need to focus on something else.
