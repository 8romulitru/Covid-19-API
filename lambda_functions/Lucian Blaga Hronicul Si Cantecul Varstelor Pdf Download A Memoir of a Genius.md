# Lucian Blaga Hronicul Si Cantecul Varstelor Pdf Download: A Memoir of Childhood and Philosophy
 
Lucian Blaga (1895-1961) was one of the most prominent Romanian poets, philosophers, and cultural figures of the 20th century. He is best known for his metaphysical system of culture and history, his lyrical poetry, and his role as a defender of Romanian identity and spirituality under the communist regime.
 
One of his lesser-known works is Hronicul si cantecul varstelor (Chronicle and Song of Ages), a memoir of his childhood and youth that he wrote in the last years of his life. The book was published posthumously in 1965 and offers a fascinating glimpse into Blaga's early influences, experiences, and reflections.

Hronicul si cantecul varstelor is divided into seven chapters, each corresponding to a stage of Blaga's life from birth to adulthood. The chapters are interspersed with poems that illustrate his poetic sensibility and his philosophical quest. The book is not a linear autobiography, but rather a collection of memories, impressions, and insights that reveal Blaga's personality, worldview, and artistic vision.
 
The book begins with Blaga's description of his birth in a village in Transylvania, where he spent his first four years in silence, refusing to speak. He then recounts his discovery of language, nature, and religion, as well as his encounters with death, love, and mystery. He also describes his education in various schools and universities, where he developed his interest in philosophy, literature, and science. He ends the book with his departure from Romania to study in Vienna, where he completed his doctoral thesis on the philosophy of culture.
 
Hronicul si cantecul varstelor is a rich and captivating book that reveals Blaga's inner life and his quest for meaning and beauty. It is also a valuable document of Romanian culture and history, as well as a testimony of Blaga's courage and integrity in the face of oppression and censorship. The book can be downloaded in pdf format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], or purchased in print from bookstores.

Aside from Hronicul si cantecul varstelor, Blaga wrote many other works of poetry, philosophy, and drama that reflect his original and profound thought. His poetic works include nine volumes of poetry, such as Poemele luminii (Poems of Light), Pasii profetului (The Prophet's Steps), Lauda somnului (In Praise of Sleep), and NebÄnuitele trepte (The Unforeseen Stairs). His philosophical works include Trilogia cunoaÅterii (The Trilogy of Knowledge), Trilogia culturii (The Trilogy of Culture), Trilogia valorilor (The Trilogy of Values), and Trilogia cosmologicÄ (The Cosmological Trilogy). His dramatic works include Zamolxe (Zalmoxis), Daria (Daria), Avram Iancu (Avram Iancu), and MeÅterul Manole (Master Manole).
 
Blaga's works are characterized by a rich and complex symbolism, a metaphysical vision of reality, a deep sense of mystery and transcendence, and a lyrical expression of his emotions and experiences. He was influenced by various philosophical currents, such as Kantianism, Bergsonism, phenomenology, existentialism, and hermeneutics, but he also developed his own original concepts, such as the Mioritic space, the Luciferic knowledge, the stylistic matrix, the historical being, and the horizon. He also explored the themes of Romanian culture and identity, the role of creativity and imagination, the dialectics of knowledge and mystery, the relation between man and nature, and the meaning of life and death.
