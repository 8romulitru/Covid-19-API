## What You Need
 
- A Windows PC with a 64-bit processor that supports virtualization technology. You can check this by opening Task Manager and going to the Performance tab. If you see Virtualization: Enabled under CPU, you are good to go. If not, you might need to enable it in your BIOS or UEFI settings.
- VMware Workstation or Player. You can download the trial or full version from [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) for Workstation or [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) for Player.
- A macOS image file. You can download it from various sources online, such as [here](https://isoriver.com/category/mac-os/). Make sure you get the correct version for your desired macOS guest. For example, if you want to install macOS Big Sur, you need to download the Big Sur image file.
- VMware Unlocker. This is a tool that patches VMware to allow macOS guests to be selected and booted. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/DrDonk/unlocker/releases).[^1^] Make sure you get the correct version for your VMware product. For example, if you have VMware Workstation 16 or 17, you need to get Unlocker 4.
- Hardware Virtualization Bypasser. This is a tool that patches VMware to bypass the hardware virtualization check for macOS guests. You can download it from [here](https://rairhymdixlanous.wixsite.com/feibritonil/post/vmware-9-unlocker-hardware-virtualization-bypasser).[^2^] This tool is only needed if your processor does not support VT-x or AMD-V, which are required for running macOS guests.

## What You Do

1. Extract the VMware Unlocker and Hardware Virtualization Bypasser zip files to separate folders.
2. Run the VMware Unlocker as administrator and follow the instructions. This will patch VMware to enable macOS guests.
3. If your processor does not support VT-x or AMD-V, run the Hardware Virtualization Bypasser as administrator and follow the instructions. This will patch VMware to bypass the hardware virtualization check for macOS guests.
4. Open VMware Workstation or Player and create a new virtual machine.
5. Select Apple Mac OS X as the guest operating system and choose the appropriate version for your macOS image file.
6. Customize the virtual machine settings as you wish. You can adjust the memory, CPU cores, disk size, network adapter, etc. Make sure you select Use an existing virtual disk as the hard disk type and browse to your macOS image file.
7. Click Finish to create the virtual machine.
8. Power on the virtual machine and wait for it to boot into macOS.
9. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your macOS guest.
10. Enjoy your macOS on Windows!
