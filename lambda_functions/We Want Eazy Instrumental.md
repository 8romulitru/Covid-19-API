# We Want Eazy Instrumental: A Tribute to the Legendary Rapper
 
We Want Eazy Instrumental is a song by BimaMsuppzo, a SoundCloud artist who pays homage to the late Eazy-E, one of the pioneers of gangsta rap and a founding member of N.W.A. The song samples the original We Want Eazy from Eazy-E's debut album Eazy-Duz-It, released in 1988. The instrumental version preserves the catchy hook and the funky beat of the classic track, while removing the vocals to let the listeners appreciate the production and the groove.
 
Eazy-E, born Eric Lynn Wright, was a rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur who rose to fame in the late 1980s as part of N.W.A, along with Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella. N.W.A revolutionized hip-hop with their raw and controversial lyrics that reflected the reality of life in the streets of Compton, California. They are widely regarded as one of the most influential groups in rap history and are credited with popularizing the subgenre of gangsta rap.

Eazy-E died in 1995 at the age of 31 from complications of AIDS, leaving behind a legacy that still inspires and influences many artists today.
