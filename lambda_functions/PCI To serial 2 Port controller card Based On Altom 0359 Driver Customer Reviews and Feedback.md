# How to Install a PCI to Serial 2 Port Controller Card Based on Altom 0359 Driver
  
If you need to add more serial ports to your computer, one of the easiest ways is to use a PCI to serial 2 port controller card. This card plugs into a PCI slot on your motherboard and provides two RS-232 serial ports that can be used for connecting various devices, such as modems, printers, scanners, etc.
  
However, not all PCI to serial cards are the same. Some of them use different chipsets and drivers that may not be compatible with your operating system or device. One of the most reliable and widely used chipsets is the Altom 0359 driver, which is based on the 16550 UART standard and supports high-speed data transfer and IRQ sharing.

In this article, we will show you how to install a PCI to serial 2 port controller card based on Altom 0359 driver on your Windows PC. We will also provide some tips on how to troubleshoot common issues that may arise during or after the installation process.
  
## Step 1: Prepare Your PC and Card
  
Before you start the installation, you need to make sure that your PC meets the following requirements:
  
- It has an available PCI slot that is compatible with the card. You can check this by opening your PC case and looking at the slots on your motherboard. PCI slots are usually white or beige and have a notch at one end.
- It has a power supply that can provide enough power for the card and other devices. You can check this by looking at the label on your power supply unit (PSU) and comparing it with the power consumption of the card and other devices. The card usually requires about 5W of power.
- It has an operating system that supports the card and its driver. The card is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10, and Linux. The driver is available on the CD-ROM that comes with the card or on the manufacturer's website.

Once you have verified that your PC meets these requirements, you need to prepare your card for installation. You can do this by following these steps:

- Unpack the card from its packaging and inspect it for any damage or defects. If you find any, contact the seller or manufacturer for a replacement.
- Remove any protective covers or stickers from the card and its connectors.
- If your card comes with a low-profile bracket, you may need to replace it with a standard bracket if your PC case has a full-height slot. To do this, unscrew the bracket from the card and attach the new one with the same screws.

## Step 2: Install the Card in Your PC
  
After you have prepared your card, you can install it in your PC by following these steps:

- Turn off your PC and unplug it from the power source.
- Open your PC case by removing the screws or latches that secure it.
- Locate an available PCI slot on your motherboard and remove the metal cover that blocks it. You may need to unscrew or snap off the cover.
- Gently insert the card into the slot and push it down firmly until it clicks into place. Make sure that the card is aligned with the slot and that no pins are bent or broken.
- Screw or snap on the metal cover that secures the card to the case.
- Close your PC case and plug it back into the power source.

## Step 3: Install the Driver for Your Card
  
After you have installed your card in your PC, you need to install the driver for it to work properly. You can do this by following these steps:

- Turn on your PC and wait for it to boot up.
- If your operating system detects the new hardware automatically, follow the instructions on the screen to install the driver. You may need to insert the CD-ROM that comes with the card or download the driver from the manufacturer's website.
- If your operating system does not detect the new hardware automatically, you need to install the driver manually. To do this, open Device
