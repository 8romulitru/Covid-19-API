## How to Create Your Ragnarok Guild Emblems 76
 
To create your own Ragnarok guild emblems 76, you will need an Emperium, which is an item that allows you to form a guild in the game. You can obtain an Emperium by hunting monsters, buying from other players, or crafting with materials. Once you have an Emperium, you can create a guild by typing /guild "guild name" in the chat window. The character you made the guild on is now the Guild Master.
 
Next, you will need to choose an emblem for your guild. You can browse the Ragnarok Guild Emblems 76 collection on OpenSea and find one that suits your preference. You can also filter the emblems by price, quantity, currency, or status. To buy an emblem, you will need to have a digital wallet that supports Ethereum, such as MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet. You can then make an offer or bid on the emblem you want.
 
Once you have purchased an emblem, you will need to download it as a .bmp file and save it in your Ragnarok Online folder. The file name should be emblem.bmp and the size should be 24x24 pixels. You can also edit the emblem using any image editing software, such as Photoshop or GIMP. You can change the color, placement, or shape of the emblem as you wish.
 
## How to Customize Your Ragnarok Guild Emblems 76
 
To customize your Ragnarok guild emblems 76, you will need to access the Guild Window in-game by pressing Alt+G. This window is the interface used to change anything related to the guild, such as the members, titles, skills, notice, and alliances. To change the emblem, you will need to go to the Position Tab and click on the Edit button next to the Emblem option. You can then browse your computer and select the emblem.bmp file that you downloaded or edited.
 
You can also customize other aspects of your guild using the Guild Window. For example, you can change the name and permissions of each title using the Position Tab. You can also learn and use guild skills using the Guild Skills Tab. You can write a two-line guild notice that will be displayed to each member upon logging in or switching maps using the Guild Notice Tab.
