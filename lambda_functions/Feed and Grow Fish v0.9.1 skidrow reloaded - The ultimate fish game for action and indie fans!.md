- When you open your mouth or swallow while swimming, you become slower, so don't hold your mouth open while you're chasing something, because it slows you down[^1^].
- Don't use all of your stamina. When you get to 3 or 2 bars, you don't speed up. You can also keep tapping shift to sprint without using too much stamina. Useful for getting away or chasing something[^1^].
- You can hide in seaweed and no other fish can see you! (Unless the enemy is right next to you inside the seaweed, which you make it attack you). This is very useful if you run out of stamina and can't regain it if something fast is chasing you[^1^].
- Staying still makes your stamina regenerate a lot faster, so stay still if you need to gain stamina back fast[^1^].
- Double tapping shift makes your fish perform a tail whip, which will shake off, damage, and stun fish that are latched on to you. You cannot stun bigger fish that are your size and up, but can still do a bit of damage. Much bigger fish won't get stunned, shaken off, or damaged. This feature could really help you escape from predators[^1^]!
- There are many playable fish that can easily level up fast and take out some bosses. Here are some fish you should think about playing as: Ichthyosaurus (extremely fast, levels up fast, can feed on helpless whale sharks for easy EXP), Dorudon (does a lot of damage, level 15 Dorudon should be able to take out a great white shark), Barracuda (fast and agile, can take down bigger fish with its passive ability that increases damage with each consecutive bite), Pike (can swallow huge things, including the great white shark at level 365)[^2^].
- To defeat the bosses, you need to be smart and strategic. You can use the environment to your advantage, such as hiding in seaweed or coral reefs, or luring them into traps or ambushes. You can also use teamwork with other fish of your kind or allies to overwhelm them. You can also exploit their weaknesses, such as their blind spots or low stamina[^3^].

With these tips and tricks, you should be able to enjoy the game more and become a better player. Feed and Grow: Fish v0.9.1 is a fun and challenging game that lets you experience life as a fish in a realistic and beautiful sea world. If you love animal survival games, you should definitely give it a try.
