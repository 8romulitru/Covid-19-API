Geartrax 2016 is more than a library program. Each part model is created with its specific requirements just as a designer would, but rather than taking hours or days, the part is created in seconds. Geartrax 2016 also integrates with Excel to create data sheets. It is intuitively easy to use for the designer with limited gear experience yet powerful enough for the gear expert. The animation window shows the spur/helical gear mesh which updates as the data is changed. It is extremely useful in understanding how changes to the gear parameters reflect on the gear mesh[^4^] [^5^].
 
However, Geartrax 2016 is not a free software. It requires a license key to activate and use. Some users may try to find a crack or a patch to bypass the license verification and use Geartrax 2016 for free. This is not only illegal but also risky, as it may expose the user's computer to malware or viruses. Moreover, using a cracked version of Geartrax 2016 may result in errors, bugs or crashes that can compromise the quality and accuracy of the models created.
 
Therefore, it is highly recommended to purchase a legitimate license of Geartrax 2016 from the official website of Camnetics, Inc., the developer of Geartrax 2016. Camnetics, Inc. is dedicated to improving the way automation components are designed and has been a SOLIDWORKS Solution Partner since 1998[^4^]. By purchasing a license of Geartrax 2016, the user can enjoy the full features and benefits of this powerful software product and also support the development and innovation of Camnetics, Inc.
 
Geartrax 2016 is a valuable tool for any designer who needs to create solid models of drive components quickly and easily. It can save time, money and effort while ensuring high quality and accuracy of the models.

- **True involute tooth profiles:** Geartrax 2016 creates gears and splines with true involute tooth profiles, which are the most common and optimal profiles for transmitting power and motion. True involute tooth profiles ensure smooth and efficient meshing of the gears and splines, as well as minimal wear and tear. Geartrax 2016 also allows the user to specify the pressure angle, pitch, module, number of teeth, helix angle, face width and other parameters of the gears and splines .
- **Animation window:** Geartrax 2016 has an animation window that shows the spur/helical gear mesh which updates as the data is changed. This is extremely useful in understanding how changes to the gear parameters reflect on the gear mesh. The user can also adjust the speed and direction of the animation, as well as zoom in and out to see the details of the gear mesh .
- **Data sheets:** Geartrax 2016 integrates with Excel to create data sheets that contain all the relevant information about the gears and splines created. The data sheets can be customized by the user to include or exclude any parameters or calculations. The data sheets can also be exported to text or CSV files for further processing or analysis .
- **Compatibility:** Geartrax 2016 is compatible with SOLIDWORKS, Solid Edge and AutoDesk Inventor, which are some of the most popular and widely used CAD software products in the market. Geartrax 2016 creates the models in these software products just as a designer would. Annotating a drawing or part file is simple. Geartrax 2016 can also be run as a standalone program if the user does not have any of these software products installed .
- **Affordability:** Geartrax 2016 is very affordable compared to other similar software products in the market. It has a one-time purchase price that includes free updates for one year. The user can also choose between a standard and a PRO version for higher functionality. The PRO version has a full screen mode that allows the user to see more details of the models created .
