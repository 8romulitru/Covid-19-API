## Step 2: Install Forge
 
Kovacics Mod Pack 147 requires Forge to run properly. Forge is a modding API that allows multiple mods to work together without conflicts. To install Forge, you will need to download the installer from [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.4.7.html). Choose the version that matches your Minecraft version (1.4.7) and click on the "Installer" button. You will get a jar file named "forge-1.4.7-6.6.2.534-installer.jar" in your downloads folder.
 
To run the installer, you will need to have Java installed on your PC. If you don't have Java, you can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Once you have Java, double-click on the jar file and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to select "Install client" and choose your Minecraft folder as the destination. The installer will create a new profile in your Minecraft launcher called "Forge".
 
## Step 3: Extract Kovacics Mod Pack 147
 
Now that you have Forge installed, you can extract Kovacics Mod Pack 147 to your mods folder. To do this, you will need a program that can open zip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download WinRAR from [here](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html) or 7-Zip from [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html). Once you have one of these programs, right-click on the zip file and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to KMP\_147". You will get a folder named "KMP\_147" with several subfolders inside.
 
Next, open your Minecraft folder by pressing Windows + R on your keyboard and typing "%appdata%\.minecraft" (without the quotes) in the run box. You will see a folder named "mods" inside your Minecraft folder. If you don't see it, create one by right-clicking and choosing "New > Folder". Then, copy and paste all the subfolders from the "KMP\_147" folder into the "mods" folder.
 
## Step 4: Launch Minecraft with Forge and Kovacics Mod Pack 147
