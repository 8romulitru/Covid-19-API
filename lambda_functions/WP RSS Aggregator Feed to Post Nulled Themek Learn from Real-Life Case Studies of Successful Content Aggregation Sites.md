The add-on also displays the title, date and source of each item, which helps your readers identify the original source and publication time. This add-on works with the WP RSS Aggregator shortcode, which lets you customize the appearance and functionality of your feed list. However, if you use Feed to Post or Full Text options, the add-on will not apply and your feed items will follow the style of your theme.

This add-on is ideal for creating a curated list of news articles, blog posts, podcasts, videos or any other type of content that has an image associated with it. You can choose from different layouts and sizes for the thumbnails and excerpts, and adjust the settings to suit your preferences. You can also filter the feed items by keywords, categories or tags to display only the most relevant content for your audience.
  
To use this add-on, you need to have the WP RSS Aggregator plugin installed and activated on your WordPress site. You can then create a feed source with the URL of the RSS feed you want to import and display. Once you have added the feed source, you can use the [wp-rss-aggregator] shortcode to insert the feed list anywhere on your site. You can also use the shortcode parameters to customize the appearance and behavior of the feed list.
  
This add-on is compatible with other WP RSS Aggregator add-ons, such as Feed to Post, Full Text RSS Feeds, Categories and Keyword Filtering. However, some features may not work as expected when using different add-ons together. For example, if you use Feed to Post to import feed items as WordPress posts, the thumbnail and excerpt will not be displayed by this add-on, but by your theme. Similarly, if you use Full Text RSS Feeds to get the full content of each feed item, the excerpt will be based on the full content instead of the original summary.
